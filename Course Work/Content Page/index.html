    <h1>7 Best Places to Visit in Sri Lanka</h1>
    <p class="mainPara">Sri Lanka is an amazing travel destination offering a wide range of places to visit. This island, located 
        in the Indian Ocean off the coast of India, presents visitors with an incredible array of environments 
        and tourist attractions to enjoy and experience. 
    </p>
    <p class="mainPara">Travelers can trace the island's fascinating history, from ancient times through the colonial period to the present, 
        in cities like Colombo and Kandy. This relatively compact island boasts eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites where that
        history is preserved.
    </p>
    <p class="mainPara">Incredible outdoor landscapes and safari experiences can be found in the country's large elephant- and 
        leopard-filled national parks, like Yala, Minneriya, and Udawalawe. Sri Lanka is also a beach-lover's 
        paradise, ringed by some of the world's most beautiful beaches, and home to a number of luxury beach resorts.
    </p>
    <p class="mainPara">When planning a Sri Lankan adventure, keep in mind that the country experiences its rainy season from 
        May through August, making December through April usually the best time to visit. The shoulder season,
        September, October, and November, is a good time to visit as well. 
    </p>

    <!---------- COLOMBO ---------->
    <section class="colombo">
        <h2 id="clb">1. COLOMBO</h2>
        <img src="images/Colombo/colombo.jpg" alt="colombo" width="450" height="338">
        <p>The capital city combines modern urban amenities with the country's colorful indigenous and colonial history. 
            As a key stop on the world spice trade routes, Sri Lanka has long held strategic importance for European 
            trading powers. The country has been a colony of Portugal, the Netherlands, and most recently the British, 
            and all these cultures blend with the Indigenous culture to form a wonderful hybrid. You can taste these 
            influences in the food, see them in the architecture and the arts, and you can really feel them in Colombo.
        </p>
        <p>The city is also filled with museums and other things to do that can help connect you with Sri Lankan culture. 
            Colombo sits on the coast, and there's a large green space and beach area right in the heart of the city 
            separating an area called Fort from the Indian Ocean. It's the city's public playground and a fun place to 
            visit, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.
        </p>
        <p>The city's new mega-tower, the Colombo Lotus Tower, is a great place to visit. The tallest free-standing 
            tower in Southeast Asia, it provides amazing views of the city. Aside from indoor and outdoor observation 
            areas, there's a fancy restaurant at the top and a popular food court in the mall at the tower base.

    <!----------- KANDY -------->

    <section class="kandy">
        <h2 id="kdy">2. KANDY</h2>
        <img src="images/kandy/kandy.jpg" alt="kandy image" width="450" height="338">
        <p>Kandy is where you go to learn about and experience Sri Lankan history. Located in central Sri Lanka, 
            the city is the former capital city of the Sri Lankan royal dynasty, the country's main capital before
            the colonial period. The high point of what's called the "Kandian Era" was between the 15th and 18th 
            centuries, when the area remained independent while most of the coastal regions were colonized by European 
            powers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be sure to visit the city's National Museum of Kandy, as it illustrates the story of the region and its 
            people via exhibits and artifacts. Nearby, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a very holy Buddhist 
            shrine, part of the royal palace complex. Kandy Lake is at the heart of the city and offers a peaceful 
            refuge from the heat. There are hiking paths that circle the lake, dotted with temples and shrines. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kandy is surrounded by mountains, which are home to many tea plantations. Some can be visited and offer 
            tours and tea tastings. It's also surrounded by rainforests. The Udawatta Kele Sanctuary is a forest park 
            located within the city limits. The forest reserve has miles of hiking trails, as well as an excellent 
            nature center with educational information.

    <!----------- UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK -------->

    <section class="udawalawe">
        <h2 id="uda">3. Udawalawe National Park</h2>
        <img src="images/udawalawe/udawalawe.jpg" alt="udawalawe national park image" width="450" height="300">
        <p>This large wildlife park is in the southern part of the country, about an hour's drive from the resort 
            area of Hambantota. The terrain and environment vary, as the park is on the border of the country's wet 
            and dry zones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visitors to the park can see elephants, as there's a large population of them, along with crocodiles, 
            water buffalo, and more. In fact, it's one of the best places in the world to see elephants in the wild 
            outside of Africa. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are leopards there, too, but they can be very hard to track or spot. There are also monkeys and 
            a large assortment of deer and small mammals. It's also an excellent place for bird-watching. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some small accommodations and guesthouses across from and even inside Udawalawe. You can 
            also visit as a day trip, the best times to visit are very early in the morning or very late in the 
            afternoon.

    <!----------- GALLE -------->

        <h2 id="gal">4. Galle</h2>
        <img src="images/galle/galle.jpg" alt="Galle image" width="450" height="338">
        <p>
            The city of Galle is about a two-hour drive from Colombo via one of the country's first modern 
            superhighways. This ancient trading port reflects its colonial history and is focused around a 
            large, 17th-century seafront fort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Galle Fort is an entire preserved walled town, now filled with boutique hotels, shops, and 
            restaurants (along with real residents). The entire area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a great place to explore on foot â€“ the entire Fort area is car-free. It's hard to 
            get lost, as you're surrounded on three sides by the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from and outside the fort, the city is surrounded by some amazing beaches. Like others 
            in the country, the wide sand beach leads into clear, turquoise water. There's even a beach 
            right beneath the iconic Galle lighthouse.

        <img src="images/hikka/hikka.jpg" alt="Hikkaduwa Beach" width="450" height="338">
        <p>
            Only 90 minutes from Colombo, this beach is all about water sports, surfing, bodyboarding, 
            snorkeling, and scuba diving. All the gear is easily available for rent from one of the 
            beachfront stands. It's one of the country's most popular surfing areas, with the best 
            waves between November and March.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beach is large, so it never feels too crowded. There are a lot of beachfront stands 
            selling all kinds of delicious local street food and a good number of small hotels and 
            guesthouses if you want to stay overnight.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also known for its coral. The Hikkaduwa Coral Sanctuary is a preserved marine area 
            and part of Hikkaduwa National Park, located just off the shoreline. It was created to 
            protect the area's coral reefs and educate visitors about coral.
